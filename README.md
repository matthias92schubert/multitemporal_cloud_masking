"#README.md" 
This repository contains a text file with a Java Script code that can be used in the Google Earth Engine API.
The code is based on the scientific research of Gonzalo Mateo-García et al. concerning cloud masking in remote sensed images. 
However, instead of Landsat 8 like in the original code, this code uses data from Senitnel 2. Furthermore, the code has been translated from Python to Java Script.

For further information on the general approach consult the original paper: Mateo-García, G.; Gómez-Chova, L.; Amorós-López, J.; Muñoz-Marí, J.; Camps-Valls, G. (2018) Multitemporal Cloud Masking in the Google Earth Engine. Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 1079
